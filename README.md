## GBM Workshop

Code (and other materials) for an introductory talk/workshop on GBMs (developed originally for an R-Ladies Meetup).

This covers basic training and scoring in xgboost, h2o and lightgbm and then some additional features such
as early stopping. The code was first developed in R, but then also ported to python. There is also some code
for tuning GBMs with random search in hyperparameter space, cross-validation etc.
